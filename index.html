    <h1>Things to do to reduce traffic</h1><br>
    <p>Traffic has probably been the cause of more anger, for more people, than anything else in the entire world. Have you ever wondered what can be done to reduce the stress, anger and frustration brought by traffic? Now you too can learn the secrets to reducing traffic with Less Traffic! Less Traffic is a service company which provides <strong>YOU</strong> with the knowledge to do just that and succeed! With Less Traffic, you can learn things that <strong>YOU</strong> can do to reduce traffic.</p><br>
    <div class="enforce">
      <h2>Enforce</h2><br>
      <p>The biggest obstacle to reducing traffic, is traffic not being regularly enforced. If traffic was regularly enforced we would see:</p></br>
      <ul>
        <img src="pictures/minmax.png" alt="minmax"/>
        <li>Less people on their phones while driving. If people weren't on their phones while driving, traffic would be faster especially on the #1 lane. There are too many distracted drivers on the road even with the hands-free driving law.</li>
        <img src="pictures/slowertraffic.png" alt="slowertraffic"/>
        <li>More people following the speed limit. You may think the speed limit I'm talking about is the maximum speed limit, but I am more concerned about the MINIMUM speed limit. The speed limit signs now, do not specify if they mean maximum or minimum speed limit, so why do people assume it means maximum. When I first started driving, the speed limit signs in California said max/min speed limit on them. They need to bring that back so that people know not to drive 45 mph on the freeway for no reason. The drivers handbook specifically says that the speed limit is determined by the conditions on the road.</li>
        <li>Have you ever wondered what the sign on some overpasses are that says "trucks ok" with an arrow over the lane are for? It's to let truck drivers know that it's ok to drive in that lane, since trucks; with over 3 axles, buses and vehicles towing; are supposed to drive ONLY in the slowest lane, or two slowest lane if the highway is 4 lanes or more. This law needs to be enfoced the most since trucks are driving in every lane now like there's no problem with it.</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="pictures/911.png" alt="911"/>
      <p>So what can we do to help enforce traffic law? Call 911 when you see someone violating these rules and say that you suspect drunk driving and a CHP officer will come enforce. When enough people get pulled over, traffic will get better.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="oosd">
      <h2>Out of state drivers</h2></br>
      <p>It's been said that California drivers are the worst drivers, but I'm here to tell you those people can't read. If they read the license plate of those bad drivers, I'm sure it would say "Arizona" 90% of the time. At the front of any and all traffic in California is an Arizona driver. I have seen this EVERY time there is traffic.</p><br>
      <img src="pictures/azlicense.png" alt="azlicense"/><br>
      <p>While Arizona is the worst, a few other bordering states may also be bad and these include Nevada, Oregon and Washington. For Oregon and Washington states you can kind of understand why since their maximum speed limit is slower than it is in California. The only thing you can do about out of state drivers is to pass them as quickly as you can before they cause an accident.</p><br>
    </div>  
    <div class="merge"/>
      <h2>Merging</h2></br>
      <p>There are so many drivers out there that think the merging lane has the right of way, but that is just untrue. To make some quick cash, let them hit you it will be 100% their fault so there's no need to give them any room. The only exception to merging is on the freeway</p><br>
      <img src="pictures/donotpass.png" alt="donotpass"/><br>
      <p>There's a sign especially made for them it's call "do not pass" and is located near the merging sign. Once word gets out that the people using the merging lane are losing money for their bad driving, people will stop using it and traffic will move more smoothly.</p><br>
    </div>  
    <div class="ttm"/>
    <h2>The traffic maker</h2><br>
      <p>What should you do if you want to exit and the traffic in that lane is really bad? Let us take for example the portion of the I805 which has an interchange to the I15 and merges with the I94 at the same time. People that want to go to the I15 will go from the exit lane and stop traffic for two lanes to the left, move 100 feet just to stop the same traffic to the right again, to get right back behind the vehicle they were behind earlier. So they stopped traffic for two lanes twice, just to be at the same spot they were in. Stop making traffic for those lanes and just wait, it's where you will end up anyways. If you wait, the people that actually want to move to the left lanes can do so and the lane you are in will move quicker. It may sound crazy, but to reduce traffic you just need to stay in the lane you need to be in.</p>

      <p>Another example is where the exit for the company "Qualcom" is on the I805. Many of the employees from the company cannot wait in line to exit, so they move from the left most lane,slowing all the lanes in-between down slowing traffic for miles behind them, to merge over to the right lane so that they can make their exit. When we have so many people like that, the company needs to make a bridge for their employees so only their people are affected by the traffic they make, instead of everyone on the highway.</p><br>
